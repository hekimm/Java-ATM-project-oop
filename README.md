# ATM Simulation

This Java project simulates an ATM interface where a user can log in and perform basic bank transactions such as checking balance, depositing money, and withdrawing money.

## Structure

The project is organized into several Java files:

- **Main.java**: Initializes the program and sets up the ATM operations.
- **ATM.java**: Handles the ATM operations including user login, transaction selections, and performing transactions.
- **Hesap.java** (Account): Represents a bank account with capabilities to check balance, deposit, and withdraw money.
- **Login.java**: Manages the login functionality for the ATM.

## Usage

To use the simulation:
1. Compile all Java files.
2. Run the `Main.java` file.
3. Follow the prompts in the console to log in and perform transactions.

## Main Features

- **Login System**: Secure login with username and password validation.
- **Transaction Operations**: Users can:
